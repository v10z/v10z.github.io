          <h1>about</h1>
          <p>My name is Vidyasagar and I am an avid traveller, photographer and scientist. I hope to share my
            experiences, thoughts, knowledge and skills through this repository. My
            background will give further context to the sections seen on the left.</p>

          <p>I was born in India, and my family relocated to Singapore when I was an infant. At the age of 18, I moved
            to England to pursue my undergraduate studies. Subsequently, I continued my graduate studies in California,
            during which time I spent a year in Switzerland. During these years, I have travelled to over 200 cities
            in
            25 countries - and more recently began logging my various travels.</p>

          <p> In recent years I developed an interest in photography, and I have added some of the finer pictures in the
            gallery section. I also share photography tips from a scientific perspective that I have learnt over
            the years.</p>

          <p>
            Science has always been my passion, from spending days buried in encyclopedias as a child to pursuing a
            Ph.D. I share some of my formal pursuits (publications, theses) as well as short notes and
            informal texts on topics from mathematics and science in the research section. Herein one can also find a
            section on scientific computing and basic programming together with sample codes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whilst I do not consider myself as a literary expert, some of my thoughts and reviews of books and
            articles (ranging across subjects) can be found in the literary section.
          </p>

          <p>Feel free to leave feedback, comments and reach out to me <a href="mailto:vidyasagar.ananthan@gmail.com">
              here</a>.
          </p>
          <p> PS: The top graphic consists of a ferroelectric core, the structure of insulin, a
            nanoporous gold simulation, a representation of simple harmonics and a lattice structure. The background is
            a picture taken in Mt. Rigi during a cloud inversion event. The graphics can by navigated by rotating while
            holding a left click and panning through a right click. More interactivity and projects will be featured in
            time and in the various sections.
